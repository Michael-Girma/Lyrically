## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding, if I merge in a pull request I look at the following
things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your
contribution.

For example:

> Logging lyrics search to database

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Logging lyrics search to database for future data analysis for recommendation engine

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me
the action you have taken to solve it.

### Is it of good quality

  - There are no spelling mistakes
  - It reads well
  - Not redundant code
  - Follows best practices


### Does it move this repository closer to my vision for the repository

The aim of this repository is:

  - To provide a convenient bot that scrapes lyrics from genius.com
  - The content is usable by someone who requests for titles through the chat
  - Foster a culture of respect and gratitude in the open source
    community.
